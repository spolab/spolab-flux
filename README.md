# CAVEAT EMPTOR

Like all other things in this repository, the goal is to provide proof-of-concept material. IT IS NOT PRODUCTION READY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# What problem is this repository solving?

This repository follows the classic `apps`, `infrastructure` and `clusters` structure recommended [here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/), specifically the one repo per team model. In addition to that, we want to address how (more or less) to elegantly solve the problem of atomic updates when a resource depends on the CRDs generated or deployed by another one. This problem is described in this [FluxCD discussion](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/1311). 

Assume you have two `HelmRelease`s and one generates `CRD`s that the other one depends from. At present, even a `dependsOn` clause will not work. Currently there are a number of ways you can 'work around' the problem:

 ## Explicitly deploy the CRDS

 Kustomizations allow the user to specify where the CRDs are located and what are the creation/update policies. This is not always optimal, because many tools nowadays dynamically deploy the `CustomResourceDefinition`. It also requires the team to check any new release and see if there are CRDs that have to be extracted.
 
 ## Separate provider and consumer in different Kustomizations 
 
 Imagine you have a `HelmRelease`, **A**, that provides the CRDs, and a `HelmRelease`, **B**, that depends from those `CRD`. The team can install A in a Kustomization and B in a separate one, making sure that the latter Kustomization having a dependency on the former (`dependsOn` clause). Because deployment atomicity is guaranteed at the single Kustomization level, each Kustomization will run a separate dry-run process. The problem with this approach is that the number of separate Kustomizations may grow very quickly, making performance and maintainability an issue.

## Solution presented

This repository shows the latter model. After a lot of experimentation, this is the only viable model. Having distinct Kustomizations per asset provides the following advantages:

 - A failed deployment does not stop other deployments
 - It is easier to analyse the problem and find a solution

The folder `clusters/development` contains a `kustomization.yaml` file that defines the Kustomizations that will be loaded.

You can see the dependency between deployments by looking at `petstore.yaml`: it requires `traefik`, `mongodb` and `kafka` installed before it can start. 

# Installation

Make sure that you have the `flux` command installed, and an empty Kubernetes cluster (EKS, AKS, or a local K3S node). Flux installation instructions can be found [here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/).

Once the CLI is installed, make sure that you are pointing to the right context with a 
 bash
 ```
 kubectl config current-context
 ```
 
Once you are sure you are pointing at the right cluster, bootstrap Flux by issuing the following command: 

```bash
flux bootstrap github --owner=spolab --repository spolab/spolab-flux --path clusters/development --personal  
```

## Corporate environments

If you want to avoid using SSH (e.g. behind a corporate firewall) add the `--token-auth` option

If the corporate proxy (very likely) uses self-signed certificates, configure the certificate authority by adding `--ca-file <filename>` option.

## Rancher Desktop

The `clusters/development` plan installs Traefik with a Dapr sidecar. For this reason, you need to disable the vendor-provided Traefik in Rancher Desktop *and* remove the CRDs. [Rancher Desktop's documentation](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/faq/#q-how-can-i-disable-traefik-and-will-doing-so-remove-traefik-resources) states clearly that those do not get removed automatically.

For the most predictable results, we recommend that you:

    a) Disable Traefik from the Kubernetes settings panel
    b) Perform a Kubernetes reset (NOT a factory reset, that will re-enable Traefik!)
